# Task Management App

This is a small task management app aimed at the academic environment. This application is web-based and uses the Flask framework.

The application records three fillable fields, these are:
- Subject.
- Task to be carried out.
- Deadline.

As you enter records, they appear in a list below the data entry box.
There is the possibility of marking the task as done, deleting it or editing it.

Notice: This project was started while I was learning Python 3 and the Flask framework. The purpose of this project is purely to give me the opportunity to learn how to code and design a web system and eventually experience the challenges that a full stack developer might face in their daily work.
